# Filament Google Maps

This package provides a comprehensive set of tools for using Google Maps within the
[Filament PHP](https://filamentphp.com) ecosystem (an application builder for [Laravel](https://laravel.com)),
either as part of an admin panel, or in standalone front end forms, tables and dashboards.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

### First release

v1.0.0 has been released, so there will be no more breaking changes.  I'm sure there will be bugs, though. Please report
any you find either on the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cheesegrits/filament-google-maps/issues) page,
or find me (@cheesegrits) on the [Filament Discord server](https://filamentphp.com/discord).

### API Usage

**IMPORTANT NOTE** - some features of this package could potentially drive up your
API bill.  If you have large tables that you display static maps on, and you clear your
cache frequently.  Or if you allow public access to forms that use geocoding, and get hit by bots.

We **strongly** suggest you set [usage quotas in your Google Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/google/maps-apis/quotas).
We are not liable if you get a surprise bill!

### TL/DR

If you just can't handle reading documentation and want to dive right in ...

```sh
composer require cheesegrits/filament-google-maps
```

... then follow these instructions to add a computed attribute to any  model(s) that will use these components (which
should already have separate lat and lng fields, even if they are empty, see the Batch Commands section) ...

```shell
php artisan filament-google-maps:model-code
```

... then start using the components, like ...

```php
use Cheesegrits\FilamentGoogleMaps\Fields\Map
...
->schema[
    ...
    // must use the computed attribute name you used on your model
    // which must NOT exist on the table itself
    Map::make('location'),
    ...
]
```

## Components

### Map Field

The **Map** field displays (unsurprisingly) a Google map, with a comprehensive set of configuration
options.  It supports coordinate updating both ways between map and form, forward and revese geocompletion, reverse
geocoding and KML layers.

![Map Field](images/form-map.png)

### Geocomplete Field

The **Geocomplete** field turns a text field on your form into a Google geocomplete field,
with optional reverse geocoding of address components.

![Geocomplete Field](images/form-geocode.png)

### Map Widget

The **MapWidget** displays a filterable set of locations from a model, with 
optional clustering, templatable labels, customizable icons, etc.

![Map Widget](images/widget-maps.png)

### Map Table Widget

The **MapTableWidget** displays a map widget, along with a Filament Table,
and reacts to all filtering and searching on the table.

![Map Table Widget](images/widget-table-map.png)

### Map Column

The **MapColumn** displays a customizable static map image, with the images cached locally
to reduce API overhead.

![Map Column](images/table-map.png)

### Static Map Action

The **StaticMapAction** is a bulk action that lets you select any number of table rows, and generate a downloadable
static map showing those locations.

![Static Map Action](images/static-map-action.png)

### Radius Filter

The **RadiusFilter** provides radius filtering against a geocomplete address,
in kilometers or miles.

![Radius Filter](images/radius.png)

### Batch Commands

The **Artisan commands** allow you to do batch processing on your location tables, either geocoding
a combination of address fields into lat lng, or reverse geocoding lat and lng to address fields.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<a name="getting-started"/>

## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites

This package is built on Filament V2, and Laravel 9.  It may run on earlier versions of
Laravel, but has not been tested.

### Installation

You can install this project via composer:

```sh
composer require cheesegrits/filament-google-maps
```

### Assets

This package handles asynchronous loading of JS and CSS assets, in both the Filament Admin Panel
and standalone pages, with no need to publish anything or modify your project.

### Preparing Models

To simplify working with coordinate data, we require a computed property on any model
being used for map data, which converts between separate lat and lng fields on your table,
and a Google Point style array of 'lat' and 'lng' keys.

To prepare your model, use the Artisan command:

```sh
php artisan filament-google-maps:model-code
```

... which will prompt you for:

- model: your model class, such as Places, or Dealerships/Dealership
- lat: your latitude attribute (existing table field) 
- lng: your longitude attribute (existing table field)
- location: the computed property name, which **should not exist** on your table

The 'location' computed attribute is what you will use when you make() your map
fields and columns.  If you have no religious preference and it doesn't already
exist on your table, just use 'location'.

It will then spit out the code for you to copy and paste to your model class.

**NOTE** - this script also gives you modified $fillable and $appends arrays if required, which will merge
any existing content of these arrays, make sure you replace the existing ones if you already have them.

### Setting your Google Maps API Key

All use of the Google Maps API requires an API key.  If you don't have one, refer to
[Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

Once you have a key, either add it to your .env file as:

```php
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_map_key_here
```
... or publish and edit the filament-google-maps.php config file.  We recommend using
an environment variable.  Note that we deliberately use the same key name used by most Google related Laravel
packages, just to make life easier.  However, if need to use a different key for this package, you may do so -
refer to the config file in the next section.

### Publish the configuration

You may optionally publish the package configuration.  The configuration comes with a set of sane defaults, so
we suggest not publishing unless you actually need to change something ... and even then, best to do it with
.env variables.

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-google-maps-config"
```
... which can then be found in ./config/filament-google-maps.php

Of particular note are the config settings for your API Keys and the cache store.  By default, we will cache all API
responses for 30 days, using your default cache driver.  For most normal usage this is sufficient, but if you expect
heavy usage, we suggest setting up a dedicated Redis store in your cache.php config, and specify this with the
FILAMENT_GOOGLE_MAPS_CACHE_STORE environment variable.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
<a name="usage"/>

## Usage

### Form Field

The form field can be used with no options, by simply adding this to your Filament
Form schema:

```php
use Cheesegrits\FilamentGoogleMaps\Fields\Map
...
->schema[
    ...
    Map::make('location'),
    ...
]
```
The name used for make() must be the one you set up as your model's computed location
property.  Note that you can have multiple maps on a form, by adding a second computed
property referencing a second pair of lat/lng fields.

#### Full Options

The full set of options is as follows.  All option methods support closures, as well as direct values.

```php
use Cheesegrits\FilamentGoogleMaps\Fields\Map

...

    Map::make('location')
    ->mapControls([
        'mapTypeControl'    => true,
        'scaleControl'      => true,
        'streetViewControl' => true,
        'rotateControl'     => true,
        'fullscreenControl' => true,
        'searchBoxControl'  => false, // creates geocomplete field inside map
        'zoomControl'       => false,
    ])
    ->height(fn () => '400px') // map height (width is controlled by Filament options)
    ->defaultZoom(5) // default zoom level when opening form
    ->autocomplete('full_address') // field on form to use as Places geocompletion field
    ->autocompleteReverse(true) // reverse geocode marker location to autocomplete field
    ->reverseGeocode([
        'street' => '%n %S',
        'city' => '%L',
        'state' => '%A1',
        'zip' => '%z',
    ]) // reverse geocode marker location to form fields, see notes below
    ->debug() // prints reverse geocode format strings to the debug console 
    ->defaultLocation([39.526610, -107.727261]) // default for new forms
    ->draggable() // allow dragging to move marker
    ->clickable(false) // allow clicking to move marker
```
The mapControls without comments are standard Google Maps controls, refer to
the [API documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/controls).

#### Geocompletion

The autocomplete('field_name') option turns the field name you give it into a Google Places geocomplete
field, which suggests locations as you type.  Selecting a suggestion will move the marker on the 
map.

If you specify autocompleteReverse(), moving the map marker will update the field specified
in autocomplete() with the reverse geocoded address (using the formatted_address component from Google).

#### Reverse Geocoding

The reverseGeocode() option lets you specify a list of field names from your form, with corresponding
format strings for decoding the address component response from Google. We use the printf() style formatting
defined by [Geocoder PHP](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder#formatters) as follows:

* Street Number: %n
* Street Name: %S
* City (Locality): %L
* City District (Sub-Locality): %D
* Zipcode (Postal Code): %z
* Admin Level Name: %A1, %A2, %A3, %A4, %A5
* Admin Level Code: %a1, %a2, %a3, %a4, %a5
* Country: %C
* Country Code: %c

To help you figure out the format strings you need, you can set debug() on the map
field, which will console.log() the response from each reverse geocode event (e.g. whenever
you move the marker).

![Reverse Geocode format string debug](images/debug.png)

#### Reactive Form Fields

If you want the map marker to react to changes to lat or lng fields on your form:

```php
    Forms\Components\TextInput::make('latitude')
        ->reactive()
        ->afterStateUpdated(function ($state, callable $get, callable $set) {
            $set('location', [
                'lat' => floatVal($state),
                'lng' => floatVal($get('longitude')),
            ]);
        })
        ->lazy(), // important to use lazy, to avoid updates as you type
    Forms\Components\TextInput::make('longitude')
        ->reactive()
        ->afterStateUpdated(function ($state, callable $get, callable $set) {
            $set('location', [
                'lat' => floatval($get('latitude')),
                'lng' => floatVal($state),
            ]);
        })
        ->lazy(), // important to use lazy, to avoid updates as you type
```

If you wish to update your lat and lng fields on the form when the map marker is moved:

```php
    Map::make('location')
        ->reactive()
        ->afterStateUpdated(function ($state, callable $get, callable $set) {
            $set('latitude', $state['lat']);
            $set('longitude', $state['lng']);
        }),
```

### Geocomplete Field

The Geocomplete field turns a field on your form into a Google Geocomplete field.  You
would usually use this **instead of** a Map field (if you want a geocomplete field together
with a map, you would typically use the autocomplete() feature on the Map field).

The Geocomplete field can operate in one of two modes.  Either independently, where you
simply use it with a normal text field on your form, e.g. 'full_address', and this component
will simply fill the field in with the formatted address returned when the user selects one
from the dropdown.

```php
use Cheesegrits\FilamentGoogleMaps\Fields\Geocomplete
...
    Geocomplete::make('full_address'),
```

The second mode is isLocation() mode, where you use it with the 'location' computed attribute field
from your model.  In this usage, when the form is saved, the currently selected address will be geocoded to your
lat and lng fields. When the form loads, if geocodeOnLoad() is specified, the current lat and lng will be reverse
geocoded to a full address (using the formatted_address field from Google).

**NOTE** - the geocodeOnLoad() feature requires API access from your server.  If you are using an API key which is restricted
to HTTP Referrers, this will not work.  You will need to add another key using the FILAMENT_GOOGLE_MAPS_SERVER_API_KEY
(see Config section), which is restricted by IP address.

```php
use Cheesegrits\FilamentGoogleMaps\Fields\Geocomplete
...
    Geocomplete::make('location') // field name must be the computed attribute name on your model
        ->isLocation()
        ->geocodeOnLoad(), // server side geocode of lat/lng to address when form is loaded
```

In isLocation mode the field on the form will be empty on load (as it's not a text field an address can be stored in).
If you want this filled in, you can use geocodeOnLoad() which will do a server side API call to resolve the lat/lng to
an address.  See the note in the config section about server side API keys.

In both modes, you can specify the type(s) of place to show, and the Places response field to use to fill the field.
Refer to the Google Places API documentation for the [Place Types](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types)
and [Place Data Fields](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/place-data-fields).  Pay particular
to the limitations on the number and mix of types - either 1 from Table 3 (like 'address' or 'establishment'), or up to
5 from tables 1 or 2 (like 'airport', 'subway_station', etc).

```php
    Geocomplete::make('location')
        ->types(['car_dealer', 'car_rental', 'car_repair'])
        ->placesField('name')
```

In both modes, you may optionally specify fields to reverse geocode the selected address component data
to, using the same method as the Map component, documented above.

```php
    Geocomplete::make('location')
        ->isLocation()
        ->reverseGeocode([
            'city'   => '%L',
            'zip'    => '%z',
            'state'  => '%A1',
            'street' => '%n %S',
        ])
        ->debug() // output the results of reverse geocoding in the browser console, useful for figuring out symbol formats
        ->updateLatLng() // update the lat/lng fields on your form when a Place is selected
        ->maxLength(1024)
        ->prefix('Choose:')
        ->placeholder('Start typing an address ...'),
```

The Geocomplete field also offers many of the samer features as Filament's TextInput,
like prefixes, suffixes, placeholders, etc.

### Table Column

The table column displays a static Google map image.  The images are created on the
server side through calls to the Maps API, and cached locally on the server (using
Laravel's default cache driver) for a default of 30 days, to prevent excessive API usage.
**See the warning at the top of this page about API usage**.

```php
use Cheesegrits\FilamentGoogleMaps\Columns\MapColumn;
...
MapColumn::make('location')
    ->extraAttributes([
      'class' => 'my-funky-class'
    ]) // Optionally set any additional attributes, merged into the wrapper div around the image tag
    ->extraImgAttributes(
        fn ($record): array => ['title' => $record->latitude . ',' . $record->longitude]
    ) // Optionally set any additional attributes you want on the img tag
    ->height('150') // API setting for map height in PX
    ->width('250') // API setting got map width in PX
    ->type('hybrid') // API setting for map type (hybrid, satellite, roadmap, tarrain)
    ->zoom(15) // API setting for zoom (1 through 20)
    ->ttl(60 * 60 * 24 * 30), // number of seconds to cache image before refetching from API
```
**NOTE** that options marked as 'API Setting' are used as part of the cache key, so changing
any of these will force a cache refresh for all images in the table (as they are displayed).

### Radius Filtering

The radius filter allows you to specify an address (using a geocomplete dropdown),
a numeric distance and an optional unit selection, and the table will be filtered to records
within the specified distance of that address.

```php
use Cheesegrits\FilamentGoogleMaps\Filters\RadiusFilter;
...
    RadiusFilter::make('radius')
        ->latitude('lat')  // optional lat and lng fields on your table, default to the getLatLngAttributes() method
        ->longitude('lng') // you should have one your model from the fgm:model-code command when you installed
        ->selectUnit() // add a Kilometer / Miles select
        ->kilometers() // use (or default the select to) kilometers (defaults to miles)
        ->section('Radius Search') // optionally wrap the filter in a section with heading
```

When using Radius filtering, there is also a RadiusAction you can use, which allows you to click a button on a row
in the table to set the address being used for the current Radius Filter ...

```php
use Cheesegrits\FilamentGoogleMaps\Actions\RadiusAction;

//

    protected function getTableActions(): array
    {
        return [
            //
            RadiusAction::make(),
        ];
    }
```

### Map Is Filter

See the Map Table Widget section below for details on how to use a map as a filter for a table.

### Static Map Bulk Action

The Static Map bulk action allows you to select any number of rows in the table, then generate a downloadable static
map of those locations, with a dialog to specify the map size, type and scale.

```php
use Cheesegrits\FilamentGoogleMaps\Actions\StaticMapAction;

        //
            ->bulkActions([
                //
                StaticMapAction::make(),
                //
            ]);
        //
```

### Map Widget

The map widget can be used either in the Filament Admin panel (see Filament docs), or
standalone as a normal Livewire component.

To generate the code for a widget, run this Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan fgm:make-widget


 Widget type (just a map, or map with integrated table [Map]:
  [0] Map
  [1] Map & Table
 > 1

 Name (e.g. `DealershipMap`):
 > LocationMapTableWidget

 Model (e.g. `Location` or `Maps/Dealership`):
 > Location

 (Optional) Resource (e.g. `LocationResource`):
 > LocationResource

Successfully created the LocationMapTableWidget in your LocationResource resource class.

Make sure to register the widget both in `LocationResource::getWidgets()`,
and in either `getHeaderWidgets()` or `getFooterWidgets()` of any `LocationResource` page.


```

If you omit the Resource, the widget will be created in the main widget folder at /Filament/Widgets, and the command will
tell you what to do if you want to use it on the front end:

```shell
Your widget has been created as: App/Filament/Resources/LocationMapTableWidget.php

If you want to use it on the front end, copy/move it to somewhere in your Livewire folder, say ...

/Http/Livewire/Widgets/LocationMapTableWidget.php

... and then invoke it from a front end Blade template like ...

@livewire('widgets.location_map_table_widget')

```

The created code will look something like this:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Livewire\Widgets;

use App\Models\Dealerships;
use Cheesegrits\FilamentGoogleMaps\Widgets\MapWidget;

class DealershipMap extends MapWidget
{
    protected static ?string $heading = 'Dealership Locations';

    protected static ?bool $clustering = true;

    protected function getData(): array
    {
        $dealerships = Dealerships::all();

        $data = [];

        foreach ($dealerships as $dealership)
        {
            if ($dealership->latitude && $dealership->longitude)
            {
                /**
                 * Each element in the returned data must be an array
                 * containing a 'location' array of 'lat' and 'lng',
                 * and a 'label' string.
                 */
                $data[] = [
                    'location'  => [
                        'lat' => $dealership->latitude,
                        'lng' => $dealership->longitude,
                    ],
                    
                    'label' => $dealership->name,
                    
                    /**
                     * Optionally you can provide custom icons for the map markers,
                     * either as scalable SVG's, or PNG, which doesn't support scaling.
                     * If you don't provide icons, the map will use the standard Google marker pin.
                     */
                    'icon' => [
                        'url' => url('images/dealership.svg'),
                        'type' => 'svg',
                        'scale' => [35,35],
                    ],
                ];               
            }
        }

        return $data;
    }
}
```

Optionally you can render your labels with Blade templates (see the Google
API docs for restrictions on what HTML markup and styling you can use), and
provide an icon (svg or png) ...

```php
                $data[] = [
                    // ...
                    'label'     => view(
                        'widgets.dealership-label',
                        [
                            'dealershipId'   => $dealership->id,
                            'dealershipName' => $dealership->name,
                            'dealershipIcon' => $dealership->icon,
                        ]
                    )->render(),
                    // ...
                ]; 
```

See the parent component code for further methods and variables you can override.

### Map Table Widget

The map table widget has all the features of the vanilla widget, but with the addition
of a Filament table underneath it.  The map responds to all filtering and searching
on the table, which is done with standard Filament Table methods and schemas.

To generate a Dealership table map, you would run the same Artisan command, but choose the Map & Table
option.  The generated code will look similar to the Map option, but with the addition of the familiar
Filament methods to define the table columns, filters, actions, etc.

```php
    protected function getTableFilters(): array
    {
        return [
            MapIsFilter::make('map'),
        ];
    }

    protected function getTableActions(): array
    {
        return [
            GoToAction::make()
                ->zoom(14),
        ];
    }
```

```php
use Cheesegrits\FilamentGoogleMaps\Widgets\MapTableWidget;

// ...

class DealershipMap extends MapTableWidget
{
    // ...
    protected function getTableQuery(): Builder
    {
        return Dealer::all();
    }

    protected function getTableColumns(): array
    {
        return [
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('name'),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('state.name'),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('phone')
                ->searchable(),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('email')
                ->searchable(),
        ];
    }

    protected function getTableFilters(): array
    {
        return [
            Tables\Filters\SelectFilter::make('state')
                ->label('State')
                ->relationship('state','state_name'),
            MapIsFilter::make('map'),
        ];
    }
    // ...
}
```

Anything you can do in normal Filament tables, you can do in this table.

Also note the use of the MapIsFilter table filter.  With this optionally included in the table filters, your map acts
as a filter for the attached table, so zooming and panning to change the visible map pins will filter the table
accordingly.

There is also an additional action, the GoToAction, available for this widget, which will zoom and pan the map to
the selected location when clicked.

<!-- ARTISAN COMMANDS -->
<a name="artisan"/>

## Artisan Commands

The following commands can also be referenced as fgm: instead of filament-google-maps:, as yes, we get tired typing that
as well.

### Helper commands

It is often useful to be able to test a single geocode lookup.  We provide two commands ...

```shell
php artisan filament-google-maps:geocode --address="1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500" -A -C -G

lat: 38.8976633
lng: -77.0365739

[
    'lat' => 38.8976633
    'lng' => -77.0365739
[

--lat=38.8976633 --lng=-77.0365739

php artisan filament-google-maps:reverse-geocode --lat=38.8976633 --lng=-77.0365739

``` 

... where the switches are optional and control what format(s) the lat/lng are given, useful for (say) getting the array to use
for setting a default location on a Map field.  Or, as we are doing here, finding the coordinates of an address to use
in the reverse lookup command, so we can check the address components formats ...


```shell
php artisan filament-google-maps:reverse-geocode --lat=38.8976633 --lng=-77.0365739
+--------+-------------------------------+
| Symbol | Result                        |
+--------+-------------------------------+
| %n     | 1600                          |
| %S     | Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest |
| %L     | Washington                    |
| %D     |                               |
| %z     | 20502                         |
| %A1    | District of Columbia          |
| %A2    |                               |

| %T     |                               |
+--------+-------------------------------+

### Batch Commands

When dealing with location data, it is common to have tables which have lat and lng date
but no address data, or vice versa.  This package provides a convenient way to process tables
to either geocode or reverse geocode them to fill in the blanks.

#### Batch Geocoding

To add lat and lng coordinates to a table with address data, run this command:

```shell
php artisan filament-google-maps:geocode
```

... which will prompt you for the following

- model - your model name, like Location or Dealerships/Location
- fields - an ordered, comma separated list of the fields that make up an address, like 'street,city,state,zip'
- lat - your lat field
- lng - your lng field
- processed - optional field name that will get set to 1 when geocoded, and excluded if it is set to 1
- rate-limit - max number of lookups per minute (max is 300, which is Google's hard limit, suggested max is 150)

Or you can skip the hand holding and issue it as ...

```shell
php artisan filament-google-maps:geocode-table Location --fields=street,city,state,zip --lat=lat --lng=lng --rate-limit=100

```
If any of your address data is a join relationship, like say you have a 'states' table and the 'state'
field is a foreign key, you can specify that in dotted notation, like 'states.state_full_name', where the first part
(states) is the **name of the relationship** on your model.

The command will select all records from your table where either the lat or lng fields
are empty (0, null or empty string).

#### Batch Reverse Geocoding

Reverse geocoding from the command line is a little trickier, as we have to decompose and
map the rather complicated address format Google returns.  For this, we use a standard printf style
formatting from [Gecocoder PHP](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder#formatters).

Rather than explain it all, here as an example terminal session ...

<details>
  <summary> (<i>click to expand</i>)</summary>
  <!-- have to be followed by an empty line! -->

```sh
fgm> php artisan filament-google-maps:reverse-geocode Location

 Name of latitude element on table (e.g. `latitude`):
 > lat

 Name of longitude element on table (e.g. `longitude`):
 > lng
 
 Optional name of field to set to 1 when record is processed (e.g. `processed`)
 > processed

Use the table above to enter your address component mapping.

Google returns a complex set of address components.  You need to tell us how you want
those components mapped on to your database fields.  We use a standard symbolic format
as summarixed in the table above to extract the address components.

Each mapping should be of the form <field name>=<format symbol(s)>, for example
to map (say) a street address to your `street_name` field, you would need ...

street_name=%n %S

... and you might also add ...

city=%L
state=%A2
zip=%z

... or just ...

formatted_address=%s %S, %L, %A2, %z

You may enter as many mappings as you need, enter a blank line to continue.

Test your field mapping.

Yes.  This is complicated.  If you would like us to look up an example record from your table
and show you what all those formats translate to, enter an ID here.  If not, just press enter.

 ID (primary key on table):
 > 1
